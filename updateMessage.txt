# Persona Bot v3.25.0 - The Developer's Compass

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

Today we have transformed the sacred scrolls of CLAUDE.md into a comprehensive guide worthy of this project's ambition. What was once a scattered collection of conventions has been forged into a unified developer manifesto.

## What's New

**Complete Documentation Overhaul** - The CLAUDE.md has been restructured from 147 lines of conventions into 323 lines of comprehensive guidance.

The new documentation illuminates:

### Quick Reference Table
Instant access to all essential commands - because great developers should never fumble for build commands:
```
make build          make tui           make start
make build-release  make test          make stop
make run            make fmt           make logs-follow
```

### Architecture Overview
A complete map of the `src/` constellation - every module, every purpose, every relationship laid bare for those who venture into this codebase.

### Coding Patterns
Distilled wisdom from the codebase itself:
- `anyhow::Result` error handling
- `tokio::spawn` and `Arc<RwLock<T>>` async patterns
- `from_env()` configuration loading
- `#[serde(tag = "type")]` tagged enums for IPC
- `#[tokio::test]` async testing
- `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` feature flags

### Common Development Tasks
Step-by-step guides for:
- Adding slash commands (5 steps)
- Adding IPC message types (3 steps)
- Adding database tables (3 steps)
- Modifying TUI screens (3 locations)

### Key Files by Change Type
A navigation matrix - from slash commands to Discord events, know exactly where to look.

### Environment Variables
Clear tables of required vs optional variables with defaults documented.

## Technical Harmony

- **Preserved**: Git conventions, Feature Version Maintenance, GitHub issue creation
- **Fixed**: `src/features.rs` -> `src/features/mod.rs` path correction
- **Consolidated**: Scattered conventions unified under clear sections
- **Added**: Architecture diagram, coding patterns, development workflows

## The Vision

This is more than documentation - it is a compass for all who venture into this codebase. New contributors will find their bearings swiftly. Seasoned maintainers will navigate with renewed precision.

*May your builds be swift and your tests ever green.*
