# Persona Bot v3.31.0 - The Council Assembles

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

Why settle for one perspective when wisdom flows from many streams? Today we introduce `/council` - gather multiple personas around a single question and let each voice be heard.

## What's New

### The `/council` Command

Convene a council of up to 6 personas to share their unique perspectives on any topic. Each council member responds in a dedicated thread, creating a tapestry of viewpoints.

```
/council prompt:"Should we refactor this monolith into microservices?" persona1:analyst persona2:visionary
/council prompt:"How should I approach learning Rust?" persona1:teacher persona2:coach persona3:scientist
/council prompt:"What makes a great user experience?" persona1:zen persona2:bard persona3:analyst persona4:gamer
```

**Parameters:**
- `prompt` (required): The question or topic for the council (5-1000 characters)
- `persona1` (required): First council member
- `persona2` (required): Second council member
- `persona3-6` (optional): Additional council members

### How It Works

1. Invoke `/council` with your prompt and select 2-6 personas
2. A thread is created for the council discussion
3. Each persona shares their perspective in sequence
4. All responses appear as styled embeds with persona identity
5. Council adjourns with a closing message

### Council Features

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Same persona cannot be selected twice
- **Unique Perspectives**: Each persona receives council context to stay in character
- **Natural Pacing**: Brief delays between responses for readability
- **Styled Responses**: Full embed treatment with name, icon, and accent color
- **Thread Organization**: All council wisdom contained in one dedicated thread

## Technical Harmony

- **New Command**: `/council` with prompt and 6 persona slots
- **Thread Creation**: Auto-creates discussion thread from initial message
- **Async Processing**: Council deliberation runs in spawned task
- **Usage Tracking**: All API calls logged with full context
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if individual responses fail

### Architecture

```
/council command received
    -> Validate 2+ unique personas
    -> Create interaction response
    -> Create public thread
    -> Spawn async task for council session
        -> For each persona:
            -> Build council-aware system prompt
            -> Call OpenAI API
            -> Post styled embed response
            -> Brief delay for pacing
        -> Post council adjournment message
```

## The Vision

No decision exists in isolation. The analyst sees the metrics, the visionary sees the horizon, the coach sees the growth opportunity, and the zen master sees the underlying truth. The council brings them all together.

*Many voices, one thread of wisdom...*
