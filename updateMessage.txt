# Persona Bot v3.29.0 - The Tag-Team Tournament

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

What if a debate need never truly end - but instead *evolve*? Today we introduce tag-team debates with full conversational awareness, plus optional auto-response mode for seamless Q&A during debates.

## What's New

### Tag-Team Debates with Full Context

Run `/debate` inside an existing debate thread, and new personas inherit the *complete* thread history - not just debate exchanges, but every interaction: questions you asked, answers the bot gave, the full context of the conversation.

```
1. Start a debate with /debate topic:AI ethics persona1:sage persona2:cynic
2. Ask questions directly in the thread (mention the bot)
3. Click Continue or End Debate when ready
4. In the same thread, run /debate with different personas
5. New debaters receive EVERYTHING - debate history AND your Q&A
```

### Configurable Auto-Response in Debate Threads

New guild setting: `debate_auto_response`

When enabled, the bot responds to any message in an active debate thread without requiring a mention. Perfect for asking follow-up questions mid-debate.

```
/set setting:debate_auto_response value:enabled
```

- **Default**: `disabled` (requires @mention to ask questions)
- **Enabled**: Bot responds to all messages in active debate threads

## Technical Harmony

- **Thread History Fetching**: `fetch_thread_history_for_debate()` retrieves up to 100 messages
- **Embed Parsing**: Extracts persona name from embed author, content from description
- **Message Parsing**: Captures user questions and assistant responses
- **Auto-Response Check**: `is_in_active_debate_thread()` queries active debate state
- **New Guild Setting**: `debate_auto_response` (enabled/disabled)

### Architecture

```
Message in debate thread
    -> Check if debate_auto_response enabled
    -> Check if channel has active debate
    -> If both true, auto-respond without mention
    -> Response captured for future tag-team debates

Tag-team debate started
    -> Fetch ALL messages from thread
    -> Parse embeds for debate exchanges
    -> Parse text for user Q&A
    -> Build unified history for new debaters
```

## The Vision

A debate thread becomes a living symposium. Ask questions, get answers, and watch as new debaters inherit the complete conversation. Every exchange enriches the context for those who follow.

*The tournament continues...*
