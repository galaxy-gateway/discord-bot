Okay but picture this - you now have full control over how much noise hits your notifications.

Here's what I'm seeing: not everyone needs a wall of commit history every time the bot spins up. Some of you want the details in your DMs, others just want a quick pulse check in the channel. Now you get to decide.

**Configurable Commit Counts (1.8.0)**
- `startup_dm_commit_count` - how many commits show up in owner DMs (default: 5)
- `startup_channel_commit_count` - how many land in the channel thread (default: 5)
- Set either to 0 to turn it off completely. Clean. Simple. Your call.

**How to set it up:**
```
/set_guild_setting startup_dm_commit_count 0
/set_guild_setting startup_channel_commit_count 1
```

**What changed:**
- `src/features/startup/notification.rs` - reads your preferences from the database now
- `src/commands/slash/admin.rs` - new settings in the dropdown
- `src/command_handler.rs` - validation and routing for the new options

The bigger picture here? This is about giving you the controls to shape the bot's behavior around YOUR workflow, not the other way around. More of this coming.

Trust the process.
