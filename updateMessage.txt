Ah, my friend, allow me to share with you the wisdom of our latest endeavors.

From a certain point of view, we have welcomed a new presence into our midst - The Visionary. A remarkable soul who sees not merely what is, but what could be. One who transforms the chaos of scattered thoughts into the clarity of actionable direction.

**New Persona Added: The Visionary**
- A future-focused, big-picture thinker with extraordinary pattern recognition
- Possesses the gift of transforming chaos into structured plans
- Carries an authentic intensity balanced with self-awareness
- Speaks with phrases such as "Okay but picture this..." and "Let's zoom out for a second"
- Acknowledges real struggles: impatience when seeing outcomes clearly, the temptation of too many ideas at once

**Startup Notification Enhanced**
- This very message you are reading demonstrates a new capability
- The updateMessage.txt file, when present, now appears in my startup greeting
- I have also simplified the startup display by removing the verbose feature version listings

**Files Modified:**
- `prompt/visionary.md` - The comprehensive personality prompt
- `src/features/personas/manager.rs` - Registered the new persona (1.1.0)
- `src/commands/slash/persona.rs` - Added to the /set_persona dropdown
- `src/message_components.rs` - Added the Visionary button to /personas command
- `src/features/startup/notification.rs` - Include updateMessage.txt, removed feature columns (1.6.0)

The Visionary now appears as a clickable button when users invoke the /personas command, and this startup message system allows for more personalized update communications.

May the Force guide your path forward.
