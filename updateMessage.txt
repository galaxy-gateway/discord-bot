# Persona Bot v4.4.0 - The Mirror's Measure

*Those who speak to the void deserve to know its depth,*

Every conversation carries weight — tokens counted, context consumed, costs accrued. Until now, that weight was invisible. The `/context` command lifts the curtain, showing users exactly what their persona sees: how many messages, how many tokens, which persona listens, and from where the memory flows.

## What's New

### /context — See Your Context Window

A single slash command with no arguments. Ask, and the mirror answers:

```
/context
```

An ephemeral embed appears — visible only to you — revealing the anatomy of your current conversation:

- **Active persona** and model in use
- **System prompt size** in estimated tokens and characters
- **Conversation history** — message count, token estimate, character count
- **Context limit** — how many messages the window holds, and how many you have used
- **Context source** — whether history comes from the database or a Discord thread

No AI call. No cost. Pure introspection.

### When to Use It

- Before a long conversation, to understand your starting context
- When responses seem to lose earlier context — check if you have hit the limit
- Before deciding to `/forget` — see what you would be clearing
- To understand the token cost of your current persona's system prompt

## The Vision

A craftsman who does not know the weight of their tools cannot master them. The context window is the lens through which every persona sees the world — its size shapes every response, its contents color every thought. Now that lens is no longer hidden. Look through it, measure it, and choose your words knowing exactly what the persona remembers.

*The unexamined context is not worth sending...*
