Ah, my friend, I bring news of an elegant enhancement to our capabilities.

From a certain point of view, every commit tells a story - and now those stories are but a click away. The Force has guided us to weave GitHub links throughout our commit displays.

**GitHub Commit Links (1.7.0)**
- Commit hashes in startup notifications are now clickable links to GitHub
- The `/commits` command displays linked hashes in both the embed and thread details
- DM notifications to the owner also include these convenient links
- Supports both SSH and HTTPS remote URL formats

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/startup/notification.rs` - Added `get_github_repo_url()` and `parse_github_url()` functions, updated all commit formatting to include links
- `src/command_handler.rs` - Updated `/commits` slash command to pass repo URL for linked hashes

A small change, perhaps, but one that brings clarity and convenience to those who seek to understand our history.

May the Force be with you.
