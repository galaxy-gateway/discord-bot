The gap in the conversation. When I sent you a startup notification, you asked me about it, and I had no memory of what I said. That disconnect - that absence of context - is now fixed.

**DM Notification Memory (startup 1.9.0)**

The problem:
- Bot sends startup notifications to owner via DM
- Owner asks bot about the notification
- Bot has no idea what it just sent

The fix:
- Startup notifications now stored in conversation history
- Both the embed summary and detailed commit info are persisted
- Bot can now discuss what it posted, reference commits, explain changes

**Technical:**
- `src/features/startup/notification.rs` - new `build_notification_text()` helper, storage calls after DM sends
- Messages stored with role "assistant" in the same channel context
- Non-blocking - storage failures are logged but dont break notification flow

**What this enables:**
- "Hey, what was that notification about?"
- "Tell me more about commit abc1234"
- "What changed in the last update?"

The conversation continues. Context preserved.

Trust the process.
