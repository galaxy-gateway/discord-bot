# Persona Bot v3.36.0 - Illuminating the Path of Costs

*Seekers of fiscal clarity,*

Every API call tells a story, but until now, we could not distinguish which features drove our costs. Today we add a new lens to see the true sources of our OpenAI spending.

## What's New

### Cost Bucket Categorization

All OpenAI API usage is now tagged with its purpose:

| Bucket | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `ask` | Generic /ask conversations |
| `debate` | /debate persona turns |
| `council` | /council discussions |
| `mediation` | Conflict mediation interventions |
| `introspect` | /introspect self-reflection |
| `reminder` | Scheduled reminder messages |
| `plugin` | CLI plugin AI summaries |
| `transcription` | Whisper audio processing |
| `imagine` | DALL-E image generation |
| `unknown` | Legacy/historical data |

### Database Migration

Existing usage data gracefully migrates with `cost_bucket = 'unknown'`. New queries enable analysis like:

```sql
SELECT cost_bucket, SUM(estimated_cost_usd)
FROM openai_usage
GROUP BY cost_bucket
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### No Breaking Changes

All existing functionality preserved. The new parameter is added seamlessly to the tracking pipeline.

## The Vision

To optimize, we must first observe. Cost buckets transform raw numbers into actionable insight. Which features deliver value? Which consume resources disproportionately? Now we can see. The path to efficiency begins with measurement.

*What you cannot measure, you cannot improve...*
