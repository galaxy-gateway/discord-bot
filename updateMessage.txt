# Persona Bot v3.37.0 - The Dashboard of Clarity

*Seekers of operational insight,*

Knowledge hidden in databases serves no one. Today we bring cost bucket analytics to the TUI dashboard, transforming raw data into visible understanding.

## What's New

### TUI Stats Screen Enhancement

The Stats screen now displays a dedicated **Cost by Feature** panel showing how each bot capability contributes to API costs:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Cost by Feature                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ask           $0.0234 ████████████  │
│ debate        $0.0156 ████████      │
│ council       $0.0089 ████          │
│ mediation     $0.0045 ██            │
│ plugin        $0.0023 █             │
│ transcription $0.0012 █             │
│ imagine       $0.0008               │
│ reminder      $0.0003               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Color-Coded Buckets

Each feature bucket has its own color for quick visual identification:
- **Cyan**: ask (generic conversations)
- **Yellow**: debate (persona debates)
- **Magenta**: council (multi-persona discussions)
- **Red**: mediation (conflict interventions)
- **Blue**: introspect (self-reflection)
- **Green**: reminder (scheduled messages)
- **Light Blue**: plugin (CLI integrations)
- **Light Green**: transcription (audio processing)
- **Light Magenta**: imagine (image generation)

### Three-Column Layout

The Stats screen now uses a three-column layout:
1. **Left**: Cost summary + Cost by Service
2. **Center**: Cost by Feature (new!)
3. **Right**: Daily breakdown + Top Users

### Updated Pricing Models

The usage tracker now supports February 2026 pricing for:
- GPT-5.2, GPT-5.1, GPT-5 series (including pro/mini/nano variants)
- GPT-4.1 series (including mini/nano)
- O-series reasoning models (O1, O3, O4-mini, deep research)
- GPT Image 1.5, Sora 2 video generation
- TTS, embeddings, realtime API

## The Vision

A dashboard should illuminate, not obscure. With cost buckets visible at a glance, you can now see exactly where your API investment flows. Which features drive engagement? Which consume disproportionate resources? The answers are now one keystroke away.

*To see clearly is to act wisely...*
