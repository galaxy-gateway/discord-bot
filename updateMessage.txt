# Persona Bot v4.5.0 - The Shared Canvas

*Why paint the same portrait seven times when one frame serves all?*

Every persona response arrives dressed in the same attire: a name, a portrait, an accent color, a truncated description. Yet this outfit was stitched independently in seven places across four files, each copy a near-perfect twin of the others. One change to the pattern meant hunting down every duplicate. No more.

## What Changed

### Shared Embed Builders

Two new functions in `core::embeds` replace all seven copies:

- **`persona_embed(persona, text)`** - builds the full persona-styled embed: author with portrait icon, accent color, truncated description
- **`continuation_embed(persona, text)`** - builds the stripped-down continuation embed for chunked responses: just color and description, no author

Handlers that need extras simply chain setters on the returned embed. The fetch handler, for instance, adds its URL footer after calling `persona_embed()`.

### What This Means

- One place to maintain embed styling, not seven
- Consistent persona presentation across `/ask`, `/fetch`, `/council`, DM responses, and mentions
- Follows the same consolidation pattern as `core::response` (which extracted 8 duplicate text chunkers)

## The Vision

A gallery does not commission seven different artists to paint the same frame. The canvas is shared; the art within is what varies. Now every persona steps through the same doorway, and if that doorway ever needs repainting, only one brush is required.

*The many speak through one voice, and the voice speaks true...*
