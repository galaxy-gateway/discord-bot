# Persona Bot v3.26.0 - Faces of the Collective

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

Today we breathe visual identity into our personas. Each of the twelve voices now has a face - carefully crafted SVG portraits that capture their essence in iconographic form.

## What's New

**12 Persona Portrait Assets** - Every persona now has a distinctive SVG avatar:

| Persona | Visual Identity |
|---------|-----------------|
| Obi-Wan | Hooded Jedi silhouette with lightsaber hint |
| Muppet | Green fuzzy friend with iconic googly eyes |
| Chef | Toque-wearing culinary artist with proud mustache |
| Teacher | Bespectacled educator with apple and book |
| Analyst | Chart and magnifying glass - data personified |
| Visionary | Crystal ball with all-seeing mystical eye |
| Noir | Fedora-shadowed detective in noir style |
| Zen | Meditating figure within the enso circle |
| Bard | Lute instrument with floating musical notes |
| Coach | Whistle and strategy clipboard |
| Scientist | Bubbling flask with DNA helix and atom |
| Gamer | RGB-lit controller with health bar |

### Infrastructure

**Portrait URL Generation** - New `get_portrait_url()` and `get_persona_with_portrait()` methods dynamically construct portrait URLs from a configurable base:

```
PERSONA_PORTRAIT_BASE_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/assets/personas
```

**PNG Conversion Pipeline** - New Makefile targets:
- `make convert-portraits` - ImageMagick conversion
- `make convert-portraits-inkscape` - Inkscape conversion

## Technical Harmony

- **Assets**: `assets/personas/*.svg` - 12 vector source files
- **PersonaManager**: Portrait URL generation with env-based configuration
- **Makefile**: Asset conversion targets added
- **Config**: `PERSONA_PORTRAIT_BASE_URL` environment variable
- **Docs**: Portrait README with conversion instructions

## The Path Forward

While Discord cannot render SVG directly, these vector sources ensure our personas remain crisp at any resolution. Convert them to PNG, host them anywhere, and watch your Discord embeds come alive with personality.

*The face reflects the soul within.*
