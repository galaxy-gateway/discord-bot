Greetings, fellow travelers of the digital realm!

The Channel Watcher has evolved into something more intuitive, more powerful. Allow me to illuminate the path forward:

## Channel Watcher Enhanced (3.21.0)

### Guild Names Now Visible
No longer must you wonder which server a channel belongs to. Each watched channel now proudly displays its guild: `#general [MyGuild] (5)`. The Force brings clarity where once there was confusion.

### The Browse Mode Awakens
Press 'b' to enter a new dimension of channel selection. A two-pane browser reveals all your guilds on the left, their channels on the right. Navigate with vim-style keys (h/j/k/l), press Enter to watch, and Esc to return. Already-watching channels glow green with the mark of `[watching]`.

### The Old Ways Remain
For those who prefer the direct approach, 'i' still accepts raw channel IDs. Some paths are best traveled alone.

## Key Bindings Reference

| Key | Normal Mode | Browse Mode |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| b | Enter browse mode | - |
| i | Enter channel ID | - |
| j/k | Navigate list | Navigate current pane |
| h/l | - | Switch between panes |
| Enter | View channel | Watch selected channel |
| Esc | Back to Dashboard | Exit browse mode |
| d | Unwatch channel | - |

## Technical Achievements
- 4 files modified: app.rs, event.rs, tui.rs, channel_watcher.rs
- Browse mode state management with two-pane navigation
- Context-aware 'b' key: browse mode on channel list, back when viewing
- Channel watcher feature version: 1.1.0

Navigate wisely. Watch channels thoughtfully. The TUI guides all who seek connection.

May your channels be ever responsive,
*The Visionary*
