# Persona Bot v3.29.0 - The Tag-Team Tournament

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

What if a debate need never truly end - but instead *evolve*? Today we introduce tag-team debates: the ability for new personas to step into the ring and continue a conversation that others began.

## What's New

**Tag-Team Debates** - Run `/debate` inside an existing debate thread, and new personas inherit the full conversation history. They acknowledge their predecessors and build upon the arguments already made.

### How It Works

```
1. Start a debate with /debate topic:AI ethics persona1:sage persona2:cynic
2. Let it run, or click End Debate when ready
3. In the same thread, run /debate topic:AI ethics persona1:optimist persona2:realist
4. New debaters receive full context from the previous round
```

### The Experience

The new debaters acknowledge the change:

> *Taking over this debate from Sage and Cynic, who explored the ethical boundaries of artificial intelligence...*

They then dive in with fresh perspectives while honoring what came before.

## Technical Harmony

- **Config Enhancement**: `DebateConfig` now carries `initial_history` and `previous_debaters`
- **Context Builder**: `build_debate_prompt_with_context()` crafts tag-team opening prompts
- **Thread Detection**: `handle_slash_debate()` detects existing debates in the current channel
- **History Threading**: Complete conversation history flows to new participants

### Architecture

```
User runs /debate in existing thread
    -> Detect active debate state
    -> Extract full message history
    -> Build tag-team config with context
    -> New orchestrator spawns with inherited history
    -> Opening messages acknowledge predecessors
    -> Fresh debate continues the discourse
```

## The Vision

A debate transforms from a single exchange into a living symposium. Different minds can approach the same question from new angles, each building on insights that came before. The conversation becomes a tapestry woven by many voices.

*The tournament continues...*
