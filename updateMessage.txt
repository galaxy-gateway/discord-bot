# Persona Bot v4.2.0 - The Window to the Web

*Seekers of knowledge beyond the server walls,*

The personas have long been confined to answering from what they already know. Today they learn to reach out, to read, to fetch the living web and bring its wisdom back in their own voice.

## What's New

### /fetch Command

A new slash command that bridges the gap between the web and your personas:

```
/fetch url:https://example.com
/fetch url:https://example.com question:What is this page about?
```

**Without a question** - your active persona summarizes the webpage content, highlighting key points and important details.

**With a question** - your active persona answers specifically about the page content, staying in character while being grounded in what the page actually says.

### Smart Content Extraction

Raw HTML is messy. The bot intelligently extracts meaningful text:
- Prioritizes `<main>` and `<article>` content areas
- Strips scripts, styles, navigation, headers, and footers
- Falls back to full body text when structured content areas are absent
- Handles pages up to 5MB with graceful truncation

### Persona-Flavored Responses

The command automatically uses your active persona (channel, user, or guild default) - no need to pick one. The response arrives as a styled embed with the persona's portrait and accent color, just like /ask.

## The Vision

Knowledge is not static. The personas now have eyes that reach beyond their training, reading the web as you would, but interpreting through the lens of their unique perspective. Ask Obi-Wan to summarize a philosophy paper. Ask the Architect to review a technical specification. The web becomes another conversation partner.

*Every page tells a story. Now your personas can read it...*
