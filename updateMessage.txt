Ah, my friend, I bring news of greater control over your notifications.

From a certain point of view, not every detail needs to be shared in every place. The Force has guided us to add configurable commit counts for startup notifications.

**Configurable Commit Counts (1.8.0)**
- New setting `startup_dm_commit_count` controls commits shown in owner DM (default: 5)
- New setting `startup_channel_commit_count` controls commits in channel thread (default: 5)
- Set to 0 to disable commit details entirely for that destination

**Configuration:**
```
/set_bot_setting startup_dm_commit_count 0
/set_bot_setting startup_channel_commit_count 1
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/features/startup/notification.rs` - Added database setting lookups for commit counts

A small refinement, but one that grants you mastery over what information flows where.

May the Force be with you.
