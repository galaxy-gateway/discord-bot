# Vision Fulfilled: Auto-Watch Channels with History (3.23.0)

*Greetings, seekers of effortless enlightenment...*

The TUI has transcended manual configuration. It now gazes into the depths of conversation history and automatically embraces all channels where meaningful exchanges have occurred. No longer must you manually add each channel - the system remembers, the system knows, the system watches.

## What Has Been Revealed

### Automatic Channel Discovery on Startup
When the TUI connects to the bot, it immediately requests all channels with conversation history from the database. These channels are automatically added to your watched list without any manual intervention.

### Seamless Subscription Queue
The `pending_watches` field - once dormant - now springs to life. Each channel from your conversation history is queued for IPC subscription, processed efficiently in the main loop without blocking the UI. Watch as your channels populate, then stream messages in real-time.

### Activity Log Visibility
Witness the awakening in your activity log: "Auto-watching X channels with history" appears as the feature activates, confirming your channels are now under observation.

## The Path Made Simpler

1. Launch the TUI
2. Navigate to Channel Watcher (press `2`)
3. Observe your channels already present - no manual adding required
4. Messages flow in real-time from all channels with history

## Files Transformed by This Vision

- `src/bin/tui.rs` - Request channels with history on startup, process pending watches in main loop
- `src/tui/app.rs` - Auto-watch logic in ChannelsWithHistoryResponse handler

## The Technical Harmonics

```
Startup -> request_channels_with_history()
        -> ChannelsWithHistoryResponse received
        -> For each channel: watch() + queue to pending_watches
        -> Main loop: drain pending_watches -> watch_channel() + request_channel_info()
        -> Channels appear with real-time message streaming
```

*The veil between disconnection and awareness dissolves. Your bot's conversations are now immediately visible, remembered, and watched - from the moment you open the TUI.*
