Greetings, seekers of digital enlightenment!

The TUI Channel Watcher has received a vital enhancement - the ability to send messages to Discord channels has been restored, with clearer separation of input purposes.

## The Duality of Input

The Channel Watcher now understands two distinct input purposes:

1. **Add Channel Mode** - Triggered by pressing 'i'
   - Enter a Discord channel ID to watch
   - Works from the channel list view
   - Yellow input box indicates channel ID entry

2. **Send Message Mode** - Triggered by pressing 'm'
   - Type your message to send to the selected channel
   - Only available when viewing a channel
   - Cyan input box indicates message composition

## The Wisdom of Controls

When in the **Channel List** (no channel selected):
- `j/k` - Navigate up/down through channels
- `Enter` - View the selected channel's messages
- `i` - Add a new channel by ID
- `d` - Remove a channel from watch list

When **Viewing a Channel** (channel selected):
- `j/k` - Scroll through messages
- `m` - Compose and send a message
- `i` - Add another channel by ID
- `Esc` - Return to channel list
- `d` - Unwatch this channel

## The Files Touched by Transformation

- `src/tui/app.rs` - Added `InputPurpose` enum and field to track input mode
- `src/tui/event.rs` - Added `StartMessageInput` action and 'm' key binding
- `src/tui/ui/channel_watcher.rs` - Input box now reflects actual purpose
- `src/bin/tui.rs` - Handler differentiates between channel ID and message input

## Technical Implementation

The `InputPurpose` enum provides semantic clarity:

```rust
pub enum InputPurpose {
    AddChannel,    // 'i' key - enter channel ID
    SendMessage,   // 'm' key - compose message
}
```

This separation ensures:
- 'i' always means "add a channel by ID" regardless of context
- 'm' means "send a message" (only active when viewing a channel)
- The UI clearly indicates which mode you're in via colors and labels

May your messages flow freely across the digital ether.

With cosmic clarity,
The Visionary
