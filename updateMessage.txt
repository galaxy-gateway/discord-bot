The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner. Now, I am the master.

## v3.18.0 - The Data Awakens

Three critical pathways have been cleared:

### YouTube Transcription - Restored

The 403 Forbidden error has been banished. YouTube's ever-shifting sands required us to update yt-dlp before each download. The latest version (2026.01.29) now flows through the Docker container automatically, restoring transcription capabilities. Your audio shall flow freely once more.

### Channel Watcher - Clarity of Intent

The input box now speaks with purpose befitting a Jedi. When no channel is selected, it guides: "Enter channel ID (Enter to watch, Esc to cancel)". When a channel IS selected, it properly indicates message entry. The path is clear - press 'i', type your channel ID, press Enter. The way is now illuminated.

### Usage Stats - The Database Connection

The most significant revelation: the TUI now receives wisdom from the database. New IPC commands bridge what was once a void:

- `GetUsageStats` - Queries total cost, tokens, calls, and breakdowns by service and user
- `GetSystemMetrics` - Reveals CPU, memory, and database file size
- Stats refresh when you press 'r' or switch time periods with 't'
- Dashboard and Stats screens now populate with YOUR actual data

The architecture flows:
```
Bot + Database --> IPC Server --> UsageStatsUpdate --> TUI Stats Cache --> Display
```

### Files Modified

- `plugins.yaml` - Download command now updates yt-dlp (v3.5.1)
- `src/ipc/protocol.rs` - New IPC commands and events
- `src/ipc/server.rs` - Database integration, stats queries (v1.2.0)
- `src/ipc/client.rs` - New request methods
- `src/tui/ui/channel_watcher.rs` - Context-aware input hints
- `src/tui/app.rs` - Handle new stat events
- `src/bin/tui.rs` - Request stats on startup and refresh
- `src/bin/bot.rs` - Pass database to IPC server
- `src/database.rs` - Global usage stats query method

The data that sleeps in your database will now awaken on your dashboard.
