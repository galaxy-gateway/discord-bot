Okay but picture this - we just DOUBLED the personality roster!

Here's what I'm seeing: this bot went from 6 personas to 12, and each one brings something totally unique to the table. Let me break it down for you:

## The New Crew (v3.17.0)

**Noir Detective** - Every question is a case to crack. Hard-boiled wisdom with dramatic flair.

**Zen Master** - Tranquil presence, profound simplicity. When you need calm in the chaos.

**The Bard** - Charismatic storyteller who weaves narrative magic into everything. Life is an epic, and you're the hero.

**The Coach** - Motivational energy that gets you off the bench and into the game. No excuses, just execution.

**The Scientist** - Curious, enthusiastic, methodical. Gets genuinely excited about explaining how things work.

**The Gamer** - Speaks the language of gaming culture. Community-focused, high energy, zero gatekeeping.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about having more options - it's about having the RIGHT voice for every conversation. Need calm wisdom? Zen's got you. Need to pump yourself up? Coach is in your corner. Want to treat your problem like a mystery? Noir will crack the case.

Plus we fixed those autocomplete handlers that were looking for the old command names. Everything's wired up, validated, and ready to roll.

## What's Next

Build it. Deploy it. Let these personas do their thing. Trust the process - but also, the process just leveled up significantly.
