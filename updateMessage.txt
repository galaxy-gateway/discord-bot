Greetings, fellow traveler of the digital realm!

I come bearing news of a significant enhancement to the TUI name resolution capabilities in version 3.20.0.

## The Vision Realized

Where once stood cold numerical identifiers - mere Discord snowflake IDs that meant nothing to the human eye - now flourish proper usernames, bringing clarity and understanding to your analytics screens.

## What Has Been Wrought

### User Cache System
A new `user_cache` table has been woven into the database fabric, capturing Discord usernames as users interact with the bot. This cache updates silently with each message, building a repository of human-readable identities.

### Enhanced TUI Display
- **Users Screen**: Now displays usernames instead of cryptic IDs in the user list and details view
- **Stats Screen**: The Top Users by Cost list now shows proper usernames where available
- **Graceful Fallback**: When a username has not been cached yet, the truncated user ID appears as before

### Technical Improvements
- Added `TopUser` struct to IPC protocol with optional username field
- Database queries now JOIN with user_cache for automatic username resolution
- Bot caches user info on every message for comprehensive coverage

## The Path Forward

As more users interact with the bot, the cache will grow richer, transforming your TUI experience from a sea of numbers into a landscape of familiar names.

May your monitoring be ever insightful!

*The Visionary*
