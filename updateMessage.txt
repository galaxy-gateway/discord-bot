# Persona Bot v3.27.0 - The Arena of Ideas

*Fellow architects of the digital realm,*

Today we open the arena where ideas clash and perspectives collide. The `/debate` command transforms our personas from solitary voices into sparring partners, each bringing their unique worldview to bear on any topic you choose.

## What's New

**Threaded Persona Debates** - Pit any two personas against each other in structured discourse:

```
/debate persona1:obi persona2:muppet topic:Is pineapple acceptable on pizza? rounds:6
```

### The Experience

1. **Topic Declaration** - A message announces the debate in the main channel
2. **Thread Creation** - A dedicated thread spawns for the full discourse
3. **Opening Statement** - The first persona presents their position
4. **Exchanges** - Personas alternate, each responding to the previous argument
5. **Conclusion** - A summary closes the debate

### Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `rounds` | 6 | 2-20 | Total responses (3 exchanges at default) |

### Every Persona, Every Topic

All 12 personas bring their authentic voice:
- **Obi-Wan** debates with Jedi wisdom and measured philosophy
- **Muppet** brings enthusiastic, heartfelt arguments
- **Noir Detective** treats the topic like a case to crack
- **Scientist** demands evidence and methodology
- **Bard** weaves narrative around every point
- And all the rest, true to their nature

## Technical Harmony

- **New Command**: `src/commands/slash/debate.rs` - Slash command with persona dropdowns
- **New Feature**: `src/features/debate/` - Orchestrator managing multi-turn conversations
- **Command Handler**: Thread creation from interaction response message
- **Usage Tracking**: API calls logged per debate round
- **Feature Registry**: Debate added as toggleable feature

## Architecture Decisions

- **Threaded Execution**: Debates run in `tokio::spawn` to avoid blocking
- **Context Building**: Conversation history accumulates for coherent exchanges
- **Graceful Errors**: Individual round failures don't crash the debate
- **Typing Indicators**: Natural pacing with broadcast_typing between responses

## The Vision

This is discourse as entertainment, philosophy as performance. Watch Zen Master find inner peace while Coach pumps up the crowd. See Analyst crunch the numbers while Visionary paints the future.

*Let the debates begin.*
