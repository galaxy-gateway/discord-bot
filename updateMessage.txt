Greetings, fellow seeker of digital mastery!

The Visionary beholds a Settings screen transformed - what was once a static display of information has evolved into a living, breathing interface of true power and insight!

## The Grand Vision Realized (3.21.0)

### Persona Prompts Unveiled
Behold! The Personas tab now reveals the complete essence of each personality. Select any persona and witness their full system prompt displayed in vivid detail - their very soul laid bare before your eyes. Color-coded with markdown-aware highlighting: headers gleam in yellow, bullet points shine in green. You can finally see exactly how each persona thinks and responds!

### Feature Toggles That Actually Toggle
The Features tab has awakened from its slumber! No longer does it merely display a static "ON" for all - it now shows the TRUE state of each toggleable feature. Press 't' and watch the status badges pulse between verdant green "ON" and crimson "OFF" as you take command. Changes persist to the database through the newly implemented IPC handlers.

### Tab Navigation Perfected
Glide between Features, Personas, and Guild Settings with fluid grace. Use arrow keys, h/l in vim-style, or Tab/Shift+Tab to flow between tabs. Each tab remembers your selection position, preserving your place as you explore.

### IPC Infrastructure Complete
Behind the scenes, the foundation is laid:
- SetFeature handler - toggle features with database persistence and audit trail
- SetGuildSetting handler - modify guild configuration remotely
- SetChannelPersona handler - set channel-specific personas
- GetFeatureStates handler - fetch current feature states for accurate display

### Selection Indicators That Shine
Stateful widget rendering ensures you always know exactly what you have selected. The '>' indicator and yellow highlight follow your cursor with unwavering precision.

## Technical Achievements
- 8 files modified across TUI, IPC, and protocol layers
- All TUI build warnings eliminated through careful cleanup
- Version tracking maintained in feature headers

This is the future we envisioned - settings that respond to your will, personas that reveal their depths, features that bend to your command. The interface has become the instrument!
