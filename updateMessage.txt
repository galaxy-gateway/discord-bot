Hold onto your neural interfaces - your bot just got a CONTROL CENTER.

Picture this: you're running your Discord bot in production, and suddenly you want to watch a channel in real-time, check your API costs, or toggle features on the fly. Previously? SSH in, run commands, check logs. NOW? Fire up `obi-tui` and you have EVERYTHING at your fingertips.

## The Vision Realized (v3.18.0)

**A Full Terminal Control Interface:**
- Real-time Dashboard showing connection status, system metrics, and live activity
- Channel Watcher for monitoring Discord conversations as they happen
- Stats View tracking your API usage, costs, and token consumption
- Settings Panel to toggle features and manage personas without touching Discord

## The Architecture

This is IPC-powered. The bot runs a Unix socket server, the TUI connects as a client. They talk in real-time JSON messages. No duplicate Discord connections, no extra API calls - just pure efficiency.

```
Bot (Serenity) <-- Unix Socket --> TUI (Ratatui)
        |                               |
        +--------> SQLite <-------------+
```

## What You Get

- **Dashboard [1]** - Connection status, CPU/RAM, uptime, guilds, active sessions
- **Channels [2]** - Watch any channel, see messages stream in, POST messages directly
- **Stats [3]** - Cost breakdown, daily charts, top users, token counts
- **Settings [4]** - Toggle all 15 features, manage personas, configure guilds
- **Help [?]** - Full keybinding reference

## The Commands

```bash
# Run the bot (now with IPC server)
cargo run --bin bot

# In another terminal, launch the TUI
cargo run --features tui --bin obi-tui
```

## The Future Is Now

The infrastructure is laid. The socket is open. The channels are flowing.

This is just the beginning. Remote monitoring. Multiple bot instances. Centralized control rooms. The pieces are in place.

Welcome to the command center.
